# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing Context Engineering Demo Streamlit application to integrate real AI responses and implement a modular architecture. The current application uses hardcoded response patterns and has grown to over 400 lines of code in a single file. The refactored application will maintain the same core functionality while providing authentic AI-powered responses and improved code organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use real AI models for generating responses, so that the context comparison demonstrates authentic AI behavior rather than hardcoded patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL call a real AI model to generate both generic and contextual responses
2. WHEN the AI model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and fallback gracefully
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL use different prompting strategies for generic vs contextual responses
4. WHEN making AI calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and timeout management
5. IF the AI response takes longer than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator and timeout message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application code to be modular and well-organized, so that it's easier to maintain, test, and extend with new industries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into distinct modules (UI, AI services, context generation, industry demos)
2. WHEN adding new industries THEN the system SHALL require minimal changes to the main application file
3. WHEN implementing industry demos THEN each industry SHALL have its own dedicated module
4. WHEN generating context data THEN the system SHALL use a centralized context generation service
5. IF the main application file exceeds 400 lines THEN the system SHALL use helper functions to reduce complexity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to continue generating realistic context data using the Faker library, so that demonstrations remain compelling and varied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating context data THEN the system SHALL use Faker to create realistic, varied data for each industry
2. WHEN a user refreshes or revisits a demo THEN the system SHALL generate fresh context data
3. WHEN displaying context THEN the system SHALL maintain the current expandable JSON format
4. WHEN generating context THEN the system SHALL ensure data is relevant and realistic for each industry vertical
5. IF context data appears repetitive or unrealistic THEN the generation logic SHALL be enhanced

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain its current UI/UX design and functionality, so that the refactoring doesn't disrupt the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the refactored application THEN all current features SHALL remain functional
2. WHEN viewing industry demos THEN the side-by-side comparison layout SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN interacting with the interface THEN response times SHALL not significantly degrade
4. WHEN viewing context data THEN the expandable sections SHALL continue to work as before
5. IF any current functionality is broken THEN it SHALL be restored before deployment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to support configurable AI models and providers, so that different AI services can be tested and compared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL support multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. WHEN switching AI providers THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent response formatting
3. WHEN configuring AI settings THEN the system SHALL support customizable parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
4. WHEN AI configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. IF an AI provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL attempt to use a fallback provider

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN AI calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required configurations
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information to users
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality rather than crash
