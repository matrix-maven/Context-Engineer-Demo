# Customer-Focused Prompt Transformation Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the comprehensive transformation of the AI-powered demo application from business consultation responses to customer-focused professional service interactions. The transformation affects all six industry demos (E-commerce, Healthcare, Restaurant, Financial, Education, and Real Estate) and represents a fundamental shift in how the AI presents itself to users.

## The Transformation Problem

### Before: Business Consultation Approach
The original system responded to user queries with business advice rather than customer service:

**Example - E-commerce Query:**
- **User:** "Show me running shoes for women"
- **AI Response:** "Here are best practices for selling women's running shoes online. Consider inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing approaches..."

**Example - Healthcare Query:**
- **User:** "I have a headache, what should I do?"
- **AI Response:** "For healthcare practices managing headache patients, consider implementing triage protocols, documentation requirements, and billing procedures..."

### After: Customer-Focused Professional Service
The transformed system responds as industry professionals helping customers:

**Example - E-commerce Query:**
- **User:** "Show me running shoes for women"
- **AI Response:** "I'd be happy to help you find the perfect running shoes! Based on your needs, here are some excellent options: [specific product recommendations with features, prices, and benefits]..."

**Example - Healthcare Query:**
- **User:** "I have a headache, what should I do?"
- **AI Response:** "I understand you're dealing with a headache. Here are some immediate steps that might help: [specific health guidance, when to seek medical attention, self-care recommendations]..."

## Template Structure Changes

### System Message Templates
System messages define the AI's professional role and approach:

#### Before (Business Consultation):
```python
# E-commerce example
"You are an e-commerce and digital retail consultant. Provide expert advice on online business operations, digital marketing, customer experience, and e-commerce best practices."
```

#### After (Customer Service):
```python
# E-commerce example
"You are a helpful personal shopping assistant. Your goal is to help customers find exactly what they're looking for by providing product recommendations, comparing options, and guiding them through their purchasing decisions. Be friendly, knowledgeable about products, and focus on the customer's needs and preferences."
```

### Generic Templates
Generic templates handle general queries without specific context:

#### Before (Business Focus):
```python
# E-commerce example
"""User Query: {query}

Please provide e-commerce and online retail guidance. Focus on best practices for online sales, customer experience, digital marketing, and business operations."""
```

#### After (Customer Focus):
```python
# E-commerce example
"""A customer is asking: {query}

As their personal shopping assistant, provide helpful product recommendations and shopping guidance. Be specific, friendly, and focus on helping them find what they need. Include product suggestions, comparisons when relevant, and practical shopping advice to make their purchasing decision easier."""
```

### Contextual Templates
Contextual templates use customer data for personalized responses:

#### Before (Business Context):
```python
# E-commerce example
"""Based on the e-commerce context provided, offer specific guidance that considers the business requirements, target market, and operational constraints."""
```

#### After (Customer Context):
```python
# E-commerce example
"""You are helping a specific customer with their shopping needs.

Customer Query: {query}

Customer Profile: {context}

Use their purchase history, preferences, and profile to provide personalized product recommendations. Reference their specific situation naturally and help them find exactly what they're looking for."""
```

## Response Format Guidelines

Each industry now includes comprehensive response format guidelines to ensure consistent, professional interactions:

### Structure Requirements
1. **Warm Opening:** Acknowledge the customer's request
2. **Clear Sections:** Use bullet points or numbered lists for organization
3. **Specific Recommendations:** Include detailed, actionable suggestions
4. **Conversational Language:** Friendly, personal tone appropriate to the industry
5. **Clear Call-to-Action:** End with helpful follow-up suggestions

### Industry-Specific Examples

#### E-commerce Response Format:
```
RESPONSE FORMAT GUIDELINES:
- Start with an enthusiastic acknowledgment of their shopping request
- Structure product recommendations with clear categories or bullet points
- Include specific details like prices, features, and benefits for each recommendation
- Use friendly, conversational language that feels personal and engaging
- End with a clear call-to-action (e.g., "Would you like more details about any of these options?" or "I can help you compare features if you'd like!")
- Keep paragraphs short and scannable for easy reading
```

#### Healthcare Response Format:
```
RESPONSE FORMAT GUIDELINES:
- Start with a caring acknowledgment of their health concern
- Structure health information with clear sections using bullet points when appropriate

- Always include appropriate medical disclaimers about consulting healthcare providers
```

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced PromptTemplate Class
The `PromptTemplate` class was enhanced with customer-focused attributes:

```python
@dataclass
class PromptTemplate:
    # ... existing fields ...
    professional_role: str = ""           # The professional role (e.g., "shopping assistant")
    customer_focus: bool = False          # Whether template is customer-facing
    response_style: str = "professional"  # Response tone and style
    personalization_elements: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)  # Context elements for personalization
```

### Validation Enhancements
Customer-focused templates include validation to ensure appropriate language:

```python
def _validate_customer_focused_language(self) -> List[str]:
    """Validate that customer-focused templates use appropriate language."""
    errors = []
    template_lower = self.template.lower()
    
    # Check for business consultation language to avoid
    business_consultation_phrases = [
        "business consultant", "business consultation", "business advice",
        "best practices for", "industry guidance", "operational details",
        "business operations", "management consultant", "practice management"
    ]
    
    # Check for customer service language that should be present
    customer_service_indicators = [
        "help", "assist", "recommend", "guide", "support", 
        "customer", "client", "personalized", "specific"
    ]
    
    # Validation logic...
    return errors
```
